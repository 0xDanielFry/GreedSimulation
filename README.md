# Greed Simulation

This is a simple simulation that uses the [Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Lotka–Volterra_equations) in an iterative way to produce a graph.

The user can change the settings as they wish to get whatever output they are looking for.
